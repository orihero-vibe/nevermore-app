# Appwrite Authentication Setup Guide

This guide will help you configure Appwrite.io authentication for the Nevermore app.

## 📋 Prerequisites

- An Appwrite account (create one at [cloud.appwrite.io](https://cloud.appwrite.io))
- Your project deployed and running

## 🚀 Setup Steps

### 1. Create an Appwrite Project

1. Go to [Appwrite Cloud Console](https://cloud.appwrite.io)
2. Click "Create Project"
3. Name your project (e.g., "Nevermore")
4. Copy your **Project ID** (you'll need this for the `.env` file)

### 2. Configure Authentication

1. In your Appwrite project dashboard, go to **Auth** section
2. Click on **Settings**
3. Enable the following authentication methods:
   - **Email/Password** (required for this app)
4. Configure your email templates:
   - **Email Verification**
   - **Password Recovery**
   - **Magic URL**

### 3. Set Up a Database (REQUIRED)

1. Go to **Databases** in your Appwrite dashboard
2. Click "Create Database"
3. Name it (e.g., "nevermore-db")
4. Copy your **Database ID**

5. **Create User Profiles Collection** (REQUIRED):
   - Click "Create Collection"
   - Name it "user_profiles"
   - Copy your **Collection ID**
   
   **Add Attributes:**
   - `auth_id` (String, required, size: 255) - Links to Appwrite Auth user ID
   - `full_name` (String, optional, size: 255)
   - `nickname` (String, optional, size: 255)
   - `type` (String, optional, size: 50, default: "user")
   
   **⚠️ CRITICAL: Set Collection Permissions (Settings → Permissions):**
   
   Go to the **Settings** tab of your collection, then click **Permissions**:
   
   1. Click "Add a permission"
   2. Select "Users" from the role dropdown
   3. Enable these permissions for "Users" role:
      - ✅ **Create** - Allows authenticated users to create documents
      - ✅ **Read** - Allows users to read documents
      - ✅ **Update** - Allows users to update documents
      - ❌ **Delete** - Keep disabled (or set to Admin only)
   
   **Alternative: Document-Level Permissions** (more secure):
   - You can also use document-level permissions
   - After creating the document, set permissions to `user:[USER_ID]`
   - This ensures users can only access their own profile
   
   **Without proper permissions, you'll get this error:**
   ```
   "The current user is not authorized to perform the requested action"
   ```

6. Create additional collections as needed:
   
   **Categories Collection:**
   - Click "Create Collection"
   - Name it "categories"
   - Copy your **Collection ID**
   
   **Add Attributes:**
   - `name` or `title` (String, required, size: 255) - Category display name
   - `order` (Integer, optional) - Display order
   
   **Content Collection:**
   - Click "Create Collection"
   - Name it "content"
   - Copy your **Collection ID**
   
   **Add Attributes:**
   - `title` (String, required, size: 1000) - Content title
   - `role` (Enum, optional) - Content role
   - `category` (Relationship, optional) - Many to one relationship to categories collection
   - `type` (Enum, required) - Content type
   - `transcript` (URL, optional) - Transcript URL
   - `images` (URL Array, optional) - Array of image URLs
   - `files` (URL Array, optional) - Array of file URLs
   - `tasks` (String Array, optional, size: 1000) - Array of task strings
   
   **⚠️ CRITICAL: Set Collection Permissions for Categories and Content:**
   - Add "Users" role with Read permissions
   - This allows authenticated users to view categories and content

### 4. Configure Platform Settings

#### For iOS:
1. Go to **Settings** → **Platforms**
2. Click "Add Platform" → "iOS"
3. Add your bundle identifier (found in `ios/nevermoreapp.xcodeproj`)
4. Add your App Store ID (if applicable)

#### For Android:
1. Go to **Settings** → **Platforms**
2. Click "Add Platform" → "Android"
3. Add your package name (found in `android/app/build.gradle`)
4. Add your SHA-256 fingerprint (optional for now)

### 5. Configure Environment Variables

Your `.env` file in the project root should contain:

```bash
# Appwrite Configuration
APPWRITE_ENDPOINT=https://cloud.appwrite.io/v1
APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id_here
APPWRITE_DATABASE_ID=your_database_id_here
APPWRITE_CATEGORY_COLLECTION_ID=your_collection_id_here
APPWRITE_CONTENT_COLLECTION_ID=your_content_collection_id_here
APPWRITE_USER_PROFILES_COLLECTION_ID=your_user_profiles_collection_id_here
```

**Important Notes:**
- Replace `your_project_id_here` with your actual Appwrite Project ID from the console
- Replace `your_database_id_here` with your actual Database ID
- Replace `your_collection_id_here` with your actual Collection ID for categories
- Replace `your_content_collection_id_here` with your actual Collection ID for content
- Replace `your_user_profiles_collection_id_here` with your User Profiles Collection ID (REQUIRED)
- Never commit the `.env` file to version control (it's already in `.gitignore`)
- After updating `.env`, restart the development server: `npm start` or `npx expo start --clear`

### 6. Configure Deep Links (for Email Verification & Password Reset)

Update the URLs in `src/services/auth.service.ts`:

```typescript
// For Email Verification
await account.createVerification(
  'https://your-app-domain.com/verify-email' // or 'exp://your-app-slug/verify-email'
);

// For Password Recovery
await account.createRecovery(
  email,
  'https://your-app-domain.com/reset-password' // or 'exp://your-app-slug/reset-password'
);
```

For Expo apps, you can use:
- Development: `exp://localhost:8081/verify-email`
- Production: `https://your-app-slug.exp.direct/verify-email`

## 🧪 Testing the Integration

### Test Sign Up Flow

1. Run your app: `npm run ios` or `npm run android`
2. Navigate to the Sign Up screen
3. Enter a valid email and password
4. Agree to terms and conditions
5. Click "Create Account"
6. You should see a success message and be redirected

### Test Sign In Flow

1. Navigate to the Sign In screen
2. Enter the email and password you just created
3. Click "Sign In"
4. You should see a welcome message and be redirected to the home screen

### Test Forgot Password Flow

1. Navigate to the Forgot Password screen
2. Enter your email address
3. Click "Next"
4. Check your email for the password reset link

## 📱 Features Implemented

### ✅ Authentication Service (`src/services/auth.service.ts`)
- Sign Up with email/password (automatically creates user profile in database)
- Sign In with email/password
- Sign Out
- Get current user
- Check authentication status
- Send password recovery email
- Complete password recovery
- Send email verification
- Confirm email verification

### ✅ User Profile Service (`src/services/userProfile.service.ts`)
- Create user profile in database
- Get user profile by auth_id
- Update user profile
- Delete user profile

### ✅ Auth Store (`src/store/authStore.ts`)
- Zustand-based state management
- Global authentication state
- Loading states
- Error handling
- Persistent user session

### ✅ Integrated Screens
- **Sign Up Screen**: Full registration flow with password validation
- **Sign In Screen**: Login with email/password
- **Forgot Password Screen**: Password recovery via email

## 🎯 How It Works

### Sign Up Flow
1. User creates account → Appwrite creates auth user with unique ID
2. System auto signs in the new user
3. **Automatic User Profile Creation**: A document is created in `user_profiles` collection:
   ```javascript
   {
     auth_id: "appwrite_auth_user_id",  // Links to Appwrite Auth
     full_name: "User Name",              // From sign up or email prefix
     nickname: "",                         // Can be set later
     type: "user"                          // Default user type
   }
   ```
4. Navigate to email verification screen

### Sign In Flow
1. User enters credentials → Appwrite validates
2. Session created → User state updated
3. Navigate to home screen

### Forgot Password Flow
1. User enters email → Appwrite sends recovery email
2. User clicks link in email → Redirected to reset password

### Database Structure

The `user_profiles` collection automatically links to Appwrite Auth via the `auth_id` field:
- **auth_id**: Appwrite authentication user ID (`$id` from auth)
- **full_name**: User's display name
- **nickname**: Optional nickname for the app
- **type**: User role/type (default: "user")

## 🔒 Security Best Practices

1. **Environment Variables**: Never hardcode API keys or credentials
2. **Password Requirements**: The app enforces:
   - At least 1 capital letter
   - At least 1 numerical value
   - At least 1 special character
3. **Session Management**: Appwrite handles session tokens automatically
4. **HTTPS Only**: Always use HTTPS endpoints in production

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

#### "The current user is not authorized to perform the requested action"
**This is the most common error when setting up Appwrite for the first time.**

**Solution:**
1. Go to your Appwrite Console → Databases → your database → `user_profiles` collection
2. Click on the **Settings** tab
3. Click on **Permissions**
4. Click "Add a permission"
5. Select **"Users"** from the role dropdown
6. Enable these checkboxes:
   - ✅ Create
   - ✅ Read
   - ✅ Update
7. Click "Save" or "Add"
8. Try signing up again

**Why this happens:** By default, Appwrite collections have no permissions set, which means even authenticated users cannot create documents.

#### "Failed to create account"
- Check your Appwrite project is active
- Verify your Project ID in `.env` is correct
- Ensure Email/Password auth is enabled in Appwrite dashboard
- Verify `APPWRITE_USER_PROFILES_COLLECTION_ID` is set in `.env`
- Check that the `user_profiles` collection exists with correct permissions

#### "Invalid credentials"
- Verify the email and password are correct
- Check if the account exists in Appwrite dashboard

#### "Network Error"
- Check your internet connection
- Verify the Appwrite endpoint URL is correct
- Check if Appwrite service is running

#### Environment variables not loading
- Verify your `.env` file is in the project root
- Restart the Metro bundler after changing `.env`
- Run: `npm start` or `npx expo start --clear`
- Check that babel plugins are configured correctly for env variables
